                he was at Davidson, a small university in North Carolina, and reveals the defining moments of his

                Ultimately, the film offers valuable insight into Curry's determination to succeed despite doubts
                and challenges. It
                tells a story of hard work, vision and deliberate choices, themes that resonate with Stephen Curry's
                famous quote,
                "Success is not an accident, success is a choice." </p>
