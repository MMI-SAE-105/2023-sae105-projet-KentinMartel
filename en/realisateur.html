                world of sport, and more specifically

                Association) and the
                challenges faced by talented young players seeking to break into the NBA. The documentary follows
                Curry's journey while
                he was at Davidson, a small university in North Carolina, and reveals the defining moments of his
                college career.
                Ultimately, the film offers valuable insight into Curry's determination to succeed despite doubts
                and challenges. It
                tells a story of hard work, vision and deliberate choices, themes that resonate with Stephen Curry's
                famous quote,
                "Success is not an accident, success is a choice." </p>
