            <p class="texte-courant">Welcome to my website dedicated to the fascinating film of NBA star Stephen
                Curry and his mythical replica. My name is
                Kentin Martel, and I'm delighted to share my passion for basketball and the inspiration I draw from
                Stephen Curry's
                career with you.</p>
            <p class="texte-courant"> Why did you choose to create this website? The answer is simple: Stephen Curry
                is much more than a basketball player.
                His extraordinary career, marked by decisive choices and unshakeable perseverance, embodies the idea
                that success is not
                an accident, but a deliberate choice.
                It's a philosophy of life that I admire and want to share with the world. This project was conceived
                with the aim of
                celebrating not only Curry's achievements on the court, but also his positive impact outside of
                basketball.
                I've also created this website because it's a project that my IUT has asked us to do and it's
                designed to test our
                skills.Every aspect of this site is designed to reflect his determination, leadership and commitment
                to noble values.
                As you explore different pages of this site, you'll discover a biography of the director, his
                inspirational quote that
                guides so many people to success, how music can harmonise with basketball, behind-the-scenes footage
                that tells his
                story, and finally, a book that completes the story of this living legend. </p>

            <p class="texte-courant"> I'm committed to keeping this site up to date with relevant and inspiring
                content. Here you will find authentic
                information and stories carefully crafted to enlighten and entertain. My goal is tocreate a
                community of Curry and
                basketball enthusiasts, and to inspire you to make deliberate choices in your own quest for success.
                This site is more than just a collection of articles; it reflects my passion for Curry and my desire
                to share his
                message with the world. I hope you enjoy every page, find inspiration, valuable information and,
                above all, share the
                belief that success is a choice.
